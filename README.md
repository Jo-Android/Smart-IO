# Smart-IO
Android project to get information from the back end using Restful API.      
     
The proposed system dives into agricultural scope by tracking the sensor's value assigned to the plant and managing the irrigation status.  
    
The Android application communicates with the back-end to get, update, and add new data to the database within the application.

# Disclamer
This app is part of a project that has been set up for demonstration purposes only!    
    
The Android project is connected to a back-end server not properly configured for security purposes. Any sensitive information sent using the Android app can be vulnerable to outside attacks.
